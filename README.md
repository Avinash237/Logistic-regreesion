# Logistic-regreesion
Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to solve binary classification problems( problems with two class values yes/no or 0/1). This algorithm analyzes the relationship between a dependent and independent variable and estimates the probability of an event to occur. Like other regression models, it is also a predictive model. But there is a slight difference. While other regression models provide continuous output, Logistic Regression is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.
